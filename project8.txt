; 1. The number of instructions in the integer part is (32).
; 2. The number of instructions in the floating part is (27).
; 3. The total number of instructiosn in part 1 and part 2 is (59).	
; prompts the user for two integers and two real numbers
; and outputs the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of the the two.
